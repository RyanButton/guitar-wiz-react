        <p className="s1">
          Learn what chords belong to each key and discover the power of chord
          progressions. Each key is very similar to one another, especially the
          major and minor key. The only really difference between the major and
          minor key is <em>where you start.</em>. For example, the key of C
          major has the exact same chords as the key of A minor (in a different
          order). This is known as the relative minor.
