          This section is intended to give you a brief overview of the basics.
          This is of the utmost importance, as everything solid must be built on
          a sturdy foundation. Get to know your guitar, inside and out, and you
          will thank yourself years down the track. Learn the fundamental
          building blocks, and who knows what you will build someday.
